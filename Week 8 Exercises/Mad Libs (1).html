        <p>Today, My fabulous camp group went to a (an) <output id="adjective1"></output> amusement park. It was a fun park with lots of cool <output id="pluralNoun"></output> and enjoyable play structures. When we got there,  my kind counselor shouted loudly, "Everybody off the <output id="noun"></output>." We all pushed out in a terrible hurry. My counselor handed out yellow tickets, and we sucrried in. I was so exited! I couldn't figure out what exciting thing to do first. I saw a scary roller coaster I really liked so, I <output id="adverb1"></output> ran over to get in the long line that had about <output id="number"></output> people in it. When I finally got on the roller coaster I was <output id="ptVerb1"></output>. In fact I was so nervous my two knees were knocking together. This was the <output id="estAdjective"></output> ride I had ever been on! In about two minuetes I heard the crank and grinding of the gears. That's when the ride begain! When I got to the bottom, I was a little <output id="ptVerb2"></output> but I was proud of myself. The rest of the day went <output id="adverb2"></output>. It was a(n) <output id="adjective2"></output> day at the fun park.</p>
