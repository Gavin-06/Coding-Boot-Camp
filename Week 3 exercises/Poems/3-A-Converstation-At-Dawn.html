    <h1>A Converstaion At Dawn</h1>
    <h2>by Thomas Hardy</h2>

    <p> He lay awake, with a harassed air,<br>And she, in her cloud of loose lank hair,<br>Seemed trouble-tried<br>As the dawn drew in on their faces there.
    </p>

    <p>The chamber looked far over the sea<br>From a white hotel on a white-stoned quay,<br>And stepping a stride<br>He parted the window-drapery.
    </p>

    <p> Above the level horizon spread<br>The sunrise, firing them foot to head<br>From its smouldering lair,<br>And painting their pillows with dyes of red.
    </p>

    <p>"What strange disquiets have stirred you, dear,<br>This dragging night, with starts in fear<br>Of me, as it were,<br>Or of something evil hovering near?"
    </p>

    <p>"My husband, can I have fear of you?<br>What should one fear from a man whom few,<br>Or none, had matched<br>In that late long spell of delays undue!"
    </p>

    <p>He watched her eyes in the heaving sun:<br>"Then what has kept, O reticent one,<br>Those lids unlatched -<br>Anything promised I've not yet done?"
    </p>

    <p>"O it's not a broken promise of yours<br>(For what quite lightly your lip assures<br>The due time brings)<br>That has troubled my sleep, and no waking cures!" . . .
    </p>

    <p>"I have shaped my will; 'tis at hand," said he;<br>"I subscribe it to-day, that no risk there be<br>In the hap of things<br>Of my leaving you menaced by poverty."
    </p>

    <p> "That a boon provision I'm safe to get,<br>Signed, sealed by my lord as it were a debt,<br>I cannot doubt,<br>Or ever this peering sun be set."
    </p>

    <p>"But you flung my arms away from your side,<br>And faced the wall. No month-old bride<br>Ere the tour be out<br>In an air so loth can be justified?
    </p>

    <p>"Ah had you a male friend once loved well,<br>Upon whose suit disaster fell<br>And frustrance swift?<br>Honest you are, and may care to tell."
    </p>

    <p>She lay impassive, and nothing broke<br>The stillness other than, stroke by stroke,<br>The lazy lift<br>Of the tide below them; till she spoke:
    </p>

    <p> "I once had a friend a Love, if you will -<br>Whose wife forsook him, and sank until<br>She was made a thrall<br>In a prison-cell for a deed of ill . . .
    </p>

    <p> "He remained alone; and we met to love,<br>But barring legitimate joy thereof<br>Stood a doorless wall,<br>Though we prized each other all else above.
    </p>

    <p>"And this was why, though I'd touched my prime,<br>I put off suitors from time to time -<br>Yourself with the rest -<br>Till friends, who approved you, called it crime,
    </p>

    <p>"And when misgivings weighed on me<br>In my lover's absence, hurriedly,<br>And much distrest,<br>I took you . . . Ah, that such could be! . . .
    </p>

    <p>"Now, saw you when crossing from yonder shore<br>At yesternoon, that the packet bore<br>On a white-wreathed bier<br>A coffined body towards the fore?
    </p>

    <p>"Well, while you stood at the other end,<br>The loungers talked, and I could but lend<br>A listening ear,<br>For they named the dead. 'Twas the wife of my friend.
    </p>

    <p>"He was there, but did not note me, veiled,<br>Yet I saw that a joy, as of one unjailed,<br>Now shone in his gaze;<br>He knew not his hope of me just had failed!
    </p>

    <p> "They had brought her home: she was born in this isle;<br>And he will return to his domicile,<br>And pass his days<br>Alone, and not as he dreamt erstwhile!"
    </p>

    <p> " So you've lost a sprucer spouse than I!"<br>She held her peace, as if fain deny<br>She would indeed<br>For his pleasure's sake, but could lip no lie.
    </p>

    <p>"One far less formal and plain and slow!"<br>She let the laconic assertion go<br>As if of need<br>She held the conviction that it was so.
    </p>

    <p>"Regard me as his he always should,<br>He had said, and wed me he vowed he would<br>In his prime or sere<br>Most verily do, if ever he could.
    </p>

    <p> "And this fulfilment is now his aim,<br>For a letter, addressed in my maiden name,<br>Has dogged me here,<br>Reminding me faithfully of his claim.
    </p>

    <p>"And it started a hope like a lightning-streak<br>That I might go to him say for a week -<br>And afford you right<br>To put me away, and your vows unspeak.
    </p>

    <p> "To be sure you have said, as of dim intent,<br>That marriage is a plain event<br>Of black and white,<br>Without any ghost of sentiment,
    </p>

    <p> "And my heart has quailed. But deny it true<br>That you will never this lock undo!<br>No God intends<br>To thwart the yearning He's father to!"
    </p>

    <p>The husband hemmed, then blandly bowed<br>In the light of the angry morning cloud.<br>"So my idyll ends,<br>And a drama opens!" he mused aloud;
    </p>

    <p>And his features froze. "You may take it as true<br>That I will never this lock undo<br>For so depraved<br>A passion as that which kindles you."
    </p>

    <p>Said she: "I am sorry you see it so;<br>I had hoped you might have let me go,<br>And thus been saved<br>The pain of learning there's more to know."
    </p>

    <p> "More? What may that be? Gad, I think<br>You have told me enough to make me blink!<br>Yet if more remain<br>Then own it to me. I will not shrink!"
    </p>

    <p> "Well, it is this. As we could not see<br>That a legal marriage could ever be,<br>To end our pain<br>We united ourselves informally;
    </p>

    <p>"And vowed at a chancel-altar nigh,<br>With book and ring, a lifelong tie;<br>A contract vain<br>To the world, but real to Him on High."
    </p>

    <p>"And you became as his wife?" "I did." -<br>He stood as stiff as a caryatid,<br>And said, "Indeed! . . .<br>No matter. You're mine, whatever you ye hid!"
    </p>

    <p>"But is it right! When I only gave<br>My hand to you in a sweat to save,<br>Through desperate need<br>(As I thought), my fame, for I was not brave!"
    </p>

    <p>"To save your fame? Your meaning is dim,<br>For nobody knew of your altar-whim?"<br>"I mean I feared<br>There might be fruit of my tie with him;
    </p>

    <p> "And to cloak it by marriage I'm not the first,<br>Though, maybe, morally most accurst<br>Through your unpeered<br>And strict uprightness. That's the worst!
    </p>

    <p>"While yesterday his worn contours<br>Convinced me that love like his endures,<br>And that my troth-plight<br>Had been his, in fact, and not truly yours."
    </p>

    <p>"So, my lady, you raise the veil by degrees . . .<br>I own this last is enough to freeze<br>The warmest wight!<br>Now hear the other side, if you please:
    </p>

    <p>"I did say once, though without intent,<br>That marriage is a plain event<br>Of black and white,<br>Whatever may be its sentiment.
    </p>

    <p> "I'll act accordingly, none the less<br>That you soiled the contract in time of stress,<br>Thereto induced<br>By the feared results of your wantonness.
    </p>

    <p>"But the thing is over, and no one knows,<br>And it's nought to the future what you disclose.<br>That you'll be loosed<br>For such an episode, don't suppose!
    </p>

    <p>"No: I'll not free you. And if it appear<br>There was too good ground for your first fear<br>From your amorous tricks,<br>I'll father the child. Yes, by God, my dear.
    </p>

    <p>"Even should you fly to his arms, I'll damn<br>Opinion, and fetch you; treat as sham<br>Your mutinous kicks,<br>And whip you home. That's the sort I am!"
    </p>

    <p>She whitened. "Enough . . . Since you disapprove<br>I'll yield in silence, and never move<br>Till my last pulse ticks<br>A footstep from the domestic groove."
    </p>

    <p>"Then swear it," he said, "and your king uncrown."<br>He drew her forth in her long white gown,<br>And she knelt and swore.<br>"Good. Now you may go and again lie down
    </p>

    <p>"Since you've played these pranks and given no sign,<br>You shall crave this man of yours; pine and pine<br>With sighings sore,<br>'Till I've starved your love for him; nailed you mine.
    </p>

    <p>"I'm a practical man, and want no tears;<br>You've made a fool of me, it appears;<br>That you don't again<br>Is a lesson I'll teach you in future years."
    </p>

    <p>She answered not, but lay listlessly<br>With her dark dry eyes on the coppery sea,<br>That now and then<br>Flung its lazy flounce at the neighbouring quay.
