    <h1>Sledge Bells</h1>
    <h2>by Jean Ingelow</h2>
    
        <p>The logs burn red; she lifts her head,
        <br> For sledge-bells tinkle and tinkle, O lightly swung.
        <br>"Youth was a pleasant morning, but ah! to think 'tis fled,
        <br>Sae lang, lang syne," quo' her mother, "I, too, was young."
        </p>
    
        <p>No guides there are but the North star,
        <br>And the moaning forest tossing wild arms before,
        <br>The maiden murmurs, "O sweet were yon bells afar,
        <br>And hark! hark! hark! for he cometh, he nears the door."
        </p>
    
        <p>Swift north-lights show, and scatter and go.
        <br>How can I meet him, and smile not, on this cold shore?
        <br>Nay, I will call him, "Come in from the night and the snow,
        <br>And love, love, love in the wild wood, wander no more."
        </p>
