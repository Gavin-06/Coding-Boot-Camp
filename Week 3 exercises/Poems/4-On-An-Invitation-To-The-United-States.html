    <h1>On An Invitation To The United States</h1>
    <h2>by Thomas Hardy</h2>
    
    <h3>I</h3>
    <p>My ardours for emprize nigh lost<br>Since Life has bared its bones to me,<br>I shrink to seek a modern coast<br>Whose riper times have yet to be;<br>Where the new regions claim them free<br>From that long drip of human tears<br>Which peoples old in tragedy<br>Have left upon the centuried years.</p>
    
    <h3>II</h3>
    <p>For, wonning in these ancient lands,<br>Enchased and lettered as a tomb,<br>And scored with prints of perished hands,<br>And chronicled with dates of doom,<br>Though my own Being bear no bloom<br>I trace the lives such scenes enshrine,<br>Give past exemplars present room,<br>And their experience count as mine.</p>
